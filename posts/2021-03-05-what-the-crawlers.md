### What is a closure?

A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. Closures are functions that have access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables.

In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
