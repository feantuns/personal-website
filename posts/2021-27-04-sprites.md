useEffect(() => { ... }, []); // runs only once when the component is mounted

Css Sprites is a way to concat images in a single image file and then with css properties like `background-position` you can crop the images with classes. This way you will be able to get any image you need inside this bigger image to use wherever you need.

This way you need to do only one request for all the images you need, which becomes faster.
