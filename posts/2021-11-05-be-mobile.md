## What we’ve seen today

### More things about SEO

### Relevance

The most basic signal that information is relevant is when a webpage contains the same keywords as your search query.

Beyond keyword matching, Google uses aggregated and anonymised interaction data to assess whether search results are relevant to queries.

### Topical authority

Another thing Google consider when ranking a website in a search query is the authority of the website in the specific area which has been searched.

> Cultivate a reputation for expertise and trustworthiness in a specific area

From Google's [SEO starter guide.](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide)

### Mobile-friendness

Did you know that 65% of Google searches [happen on mobile devices](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-mobile-searches-now-65-of-all-searches-28003.html)? That's why this is an important factor that Google consider as well when rankin a website.

This means that Google "predominantly uses the mobile version of the content for indexing and ranking" across all devices. So if your website doesn't perform well on mobile it's really probable that it will have problems ranking higher.

### How a browser determine what elements match a CSS selector

Browsers match selectors from rightmost to left. Browsers filter out elements in the DOM according to the rightmost key and traverse up its parent elements to determine matches. The shorter the length of the selector chain, the faster the browser can determine if that element matches the selector.

With the selector `p span`, browsers firstly find all the `<span>` elements and traverse up its parent all the way up to the root to find the `<p>` element. For a particular `<span>` , as soon as it finds a `<p>` , it knows that the `<span>` matches and can stop its matching.

## Main new thing

To know that 65% of Google searches happen on mobile is pretty astonishing. Your site need to be well prepared for mobile to rank high on search queries.
