## What we’ve seen today

### Another way to access object's keys

I knew only one way of accessing and looping through an object's keys, but I found another way reading the Mastering React TDD book that is this:

**Old way using Object.keys**

```jsx
let object = { a: "a", b: "c" }

Object.keys(object).forEach(key => console.log(key))

// prints:
// a
// b
```

**New way using for**

```jsx
let object = { a: "a", b: "c" }

for (key in object) {
  console.log(key)
}

// prints:
// a
// b
```

Both ways get to the same point, but I found the new way using for kinda clearer to read and understand. I think it's because of the use of a `for` loop which is pretty common in the programming world.

### Tips on writing efficient CSS

Browsers match selectors from rightmost (key selector) to left. They filter out elements in the DOM according to the key selector and traverse up its parent elements to determine matches. So avoid key selectors that are tag and universal selectors, because they match a large number of elements and browsers will have to do more work in determining if the parents do match.

BEM (Block Element Modifier) recommends that everything has a single class, and, where you need hierarchy, that gets baked into the name of the class as well, this naturally makes the selector efficient and easy to override.

Be aware of which CSS properties [trigger](https://csstriggers.com/) reflow, repaint, and compositing. Avoid writing styles that change the layout (trigger reflow) where possible.

### Ranking higher in Google

One of the key things about SEO is ranking, the position you page appears when key terms are searched. There are a lot of things that help Google determine which page should come up first. But as Andrey Lipattsev, Search Quality Senior Strategist at Google, confirmed during a live webinar in 2016 when asked about the **two most important ranking factors**, [his response](https://youtu.be/l8VnZCcl9J4?t=1827) was simple: **content and links**.

> Absolutely. I can tell you what they are. It is content. And it’s links pointing to your site.

So keep that in mind and take a look at how big a difference it makes to appear in the first 5 positions in a Google search:

## Main new thing

I think that the main new thing for today was the facts this image above brings. Look at the impact it makes to show up first in a search, that makes the whole topic of SEO a lot more interesting, to know how to show up in the first positions is one of the keys to have your site being visited organically.
