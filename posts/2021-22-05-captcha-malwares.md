A CAPTCHA is a program that protects websites against bots by generating and grading tests that humans can pass but current computer programs cannot. For example, humas can read distorted text, but current computer programs can't.

The term CAPTCHA (for Completely Automated Public Turing Test To Tell Computers and Humans Apart) was coined in 2000 by Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas Hopper and John Langford of Carnegie Mellon University.

### What is reCAPTCHA?

reCAPTCHA is a CAPTCHA system that enables web hosts to distinguish between human and automated access to websites. The original version asked users to decipher hard to read text or match images. Version 2 also asked users to decipher text or match images if the analysis of cookies and canvas rendering suggested the page was being downloaded automatically. Since version 3, reCAPTCHA will never interrupt users and is intended to run automatically when users load pages or click buttons. reCAPTCHA is owned by Google.

The original iteration of the service was a mass collaboration platform designed for the digitization of books, particularly those that were too illegible to be scanned by computers.

The system was reported as displaying over 100 million CAPTCHAs every day, on sites such as Facebook, TicketMaster, Twitter, 4chan, etc.

In 2014, Google pivoted the service away from its original concept, with a focus on reducing the amount of user interaction needed to verify a user, and only presenting human recognition challenges (such as identifying images in a set that satisfy a specific prompt) if behavorial analysis suspects that the user may be a bot. reCAPTCHA v1 was declared end-of-life on March 31, 2018.

The reCAPTCHA software is a free-of-charge service provided to websites for assistance with decipherment, but the reCAPTCHA software is not open-source.

### What is anti-malware?

Anti-malware is a type of software program created to protect information technology (IT) systems and individual computers from malicious software, or malware. Antimalware programs scan a computer system to prevent, detect and remove malware.

### What is malware?

Malware (a portmanteau (union of words) for malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network,. A wide variety of malware types exist, including computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spywarem adwarem rogue software, wiper and scareware.

### How antimalware works

Antimalware software uses three strategies to protect systems from malicious software: signature-based detection, behavior-based detection and sandboxing.

1. **Signature-based detection**

   Signature-based malware detection uses a set of known software components and their digital signatures to identify new malicious software. Software vendors develop signatures to detect specific malicious software like keyloggers, which share many of the same characteristics.

2. **Beheavior-based detection**

   Behavior-based malware detection helps computer security professionals more quickly identify, block and eradicate malware by using an active approach to malware analysiis, through examination on how it behaves rather than on waht it looks like. It is sometimes powered by machine learning algorithms.

3. **Sandboxing**

   Sandboxing is a security feature that can be used in antimalware to isolate potentially malicious files from the rest of the system.

   For example, when opening a file from an unknown email attachment, the sandbox will run the file in a virtual environment and only grant it access to a limited set of resources, such as a temproary folder, the internet and a virtual keyboard. This way if it tries to access other programs or settings, it will be blocked and identified as a malware.

### Differences between antimalware and antivirus

While the terms malware and virus are often used interchangeably, historically, they did not always refer to the same thing. A virus is a type of malware, but not all forms of malware are viruses. Viruses are the most common type of malware; they are a type of malicious code used to gain access to a computer or data network in order to cause damage. A virus is a program that can replicate itself, whereas malware is a program that attempts to accomplish a given goal but is not self-replicating. Malware became a term used to describe newer, increasingly dangerous threats spread by malicious advertising and zero-day exploits.

## Main new thing

I think the main new interesting thing was to know that the early versions of reCAPTCHA actually used the users input on deciphering the distorted words to decipher real book's words.

## Random fact

### Why do you have to say bless you when someone sneezes?

Some people believed that a sneeze causes the soul to escape the body through the nose. Saying "bless you" would stop the devil from claiming the person's freed soul. Others believed the opposite: that evil spirits use the sneeze as an opportunity to enter a person's body.
